Neodash Core - Resuscitation
===============================

### Resuscitation....WTF?  
-------------------------
Neodash was initially a developer-backed project that never gained any traction due to the developer's abandonment of the project shortly after in began in earnest. Abandoned, left for dead and ready to piled on to the growing shitcoin landfill that has been created in the greedy regions of the digital currency/distributed ledger-blockchain/cryptocurrency/altcoin universe, there was little hope for Neodash. A group of Neodash community members, however, tired of seeing good ideas turn into dead shitcoins, stepped in and took action: rewriting messy and non-functional code, creating a block explorer, website, rebrand - basically a complete overhaul of Neodash to help it survive and thrive as a viable and valuable digital currency.  Some community members even learned to write code to help save a great idea run amok.  Hence, resuscitaton seemed like the logical choice as a name for the latest version of the much improved and revamped coin.


### What is Neodash?
----------------

Neodash is an experimental new digital currency that allows for anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world--quickly, safely and with their anonymity preserved. Neodash uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central regulatory or governmental authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the Neodash network and the people and organizations that comprise its community. Neodash Core is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this new digital currency.

NeoDash is a new decentralized digital currency initially developed to correct some of the imperfections of DASH.
NeoDash uses a hash algorithm know as NeoScrypt. This balances hashrate distribution and achieves true decentralization. Obviously, the original bitcoin whitepaper (https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/what-is-bitcoin/) emphasized this quality. However, todayâ€™s bitcoin network is controlled largely by three mining companies who control millions of CPUs. Neoscrypt is protected from ASIC mining helping to keep large corporate miners out and keep Satoshi's vision of "One CPU (or GPU today), One Vote" alive today.

The indisputable advantage of NeoDash is a more cogent accrual of reward distribution when a block is found. 50% goes to the miner, 
and 50% goes to the operator of the Masternode which processes the found block's transaction(s).
